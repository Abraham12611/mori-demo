export const BASE_TOKEN_HOLDERS_PROMPT = 
`Get the number of holders for a token on the Base Chain.

This will show:
1. Total number of unique addresses holding the token
2. Indication of holder distribution
3. Basic holder statistics

You can search for a token by its name, ticker, or contract address. This information helps assess the token's distribution and community size.

Note: If holder data is not available for the requested token, I will suggest alternative ways to analyze the token's distribution.`;
